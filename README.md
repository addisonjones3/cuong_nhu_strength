## Strength vs. Power vs. Endurance
### Strength
- The ability to exert force on an object
- Can I lift the heavy thing off the ground?
- Built through lifting increasingly heavier things at a challenging, but not impossible weight
- When training for strength, rep ranges between 3 and 6 reps are most effective

### Power
- The speed at which one can exert force on an object
- How far can I throw the heavy thing?
- Built through accelerating an object as quickly as possible

### Endurance
- The duration of time one can continue exerting force on an object or do an activity
- For how long can I continue throwing the heavy thing?
- Built through performing the activity for increasingly longer periods of time
- When training for endurance, rep ranges greater than 10 reps are most effective

## Fundamentals of Building Strength
Strength is built by performing a motion with progressively heavier resistence to allow muscles to grow in size and density so that they can then produce more force
- Muscle **Hypertrophy** is the term for the size and number of muscle fibers in your muscles
- Muscle **Strength** is the term for the contractile strength of your muscle fibers
- Muscle size does not necessarily equal strength

**Progressive Overload** is a key factor in getting stronger
- Progressive overload is the principle of lifting increasingly heavier loads so one's body can adapt
- Weight must increase over time or there won't be any adaptation i.e. not enough challenge
- Weight can't be too heavy or else there can't be enough volume of successful repititions to improve i.e. too much challenge
- Practical example: push-ups
    - Student A can perform 15 excellent push ups
    - Student B can perform 4 excellent push ups
    - Students A and B can both improve through progressive overload, but not by doing the same exercise
    - If given the instruction to do 10 push-ups:
        - Student A won't be challenged and won't grow
        - Student B won't be able to meet that requirement effectively and is too challenged

**Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE)** is the principle of working to a percentage of one's maximum effort before failure
- RPE is crucial for both training hard enough to be challenged but also not so hard that form and volume are sacrificed
- RPE is often described in a percentage * 10 of one's theoretical maximum effort 
    - Ex: An RPE of 8 would be 80% of one's 100% maximum effort before failure
    - If a student can do 10 push ups and on the 11th push up they would reach failure, 8 push ups would be an RPE of 8
- Reps in reserve (**RIR**) is also a helpful framework for this same principle
    - The student in the above example would have 2 RIR (10 max reps - 8 reps = 2 reps in reserve)
- <u>Training according to one's own body's limits is the most effective and safe way to gain strength</u>
- Practical example continued:
    - Rather than give a N push ups directive, instead students A and B are told to work to 8 RPE
    - Student A performs 13 full pushups
    - Student B performs 2 full push ups and 5 negatives 
    - Both have worked equally as hard and have challenged their bodies with the same level of effort even though they performed different exercises at different difficulties

## Form and Range of Motion
**Form and range of motion are critical in order to prevent injury and build functional strength**

Neglecting form and range of motion in strength exercises promotes becoming stronger in incorrect shapes

Important queues for push up and squat form:
- Push ups
    - Elbows should be at a 45 degree angle to the shoulder or less
        - Elbows > 45 degrees away from the chest creates instability in the shoulder joint and moves focus away from the pectoral muscles into the front deltoid muscles of the shoulder
    - The back should be flat, created by bracing the core muscles
    - The chest should touch the ground (ideally)
        - Chest to ground allows the shoulders to go through the entire range of motion for the joint which builds strength and stability throughout the entire range of motion
- Squat
    - The knees should track over the middle to second outer toes of the foot and not collapse inward at any point during the exercise
    - It is perfectly safe for the knees to go over the toes
        - "Don't go knees over toes" was started following a study in the 1970s that showed the further the knees go over the toes, the more load is placed on the knees
        - This is safe and sought after since loading the knees with greater weight increases their resiliency in exercise and overall
        - If the knees are kept behind the toes, the load is placed on the low back instead which is much worse for safety when lifting greater loads
    - The hips should ideally reach parallel or below the knees in the bottom portion of the squat
        - Hip anatomy and flexibility play a large part in whether this is possible
        - Increasing stance width and foot angle can help manage depth
    - It is difficult to continue challenging the squat with only body weight, as the legs get much stronger than the upper body
        - One legged variations are the best way to continue with progressive overload

## A Practical Framework for Increasing Strength
Building strength is possible for all ability levels so long as you effectively challenge oneself with appropriate movements and levels of effort

It is critical to find the movements variations that allow for RPE ~8 within the rep range (3 - 6) for building strength and pushing ones maximum number of reps when building endurance

Training to failure is useful for hypertrophy (muscle size) training, but sub-optimal for strength and endurance. Each set after a set that goes to failure will be less effective than the last.

Case study for Student A:
- Student A can currently do 15 maximum full push ups
- To build more strength, Student A can do 5 archer push ups per side at an RPE of 8
- Aim for 4 sets per class
- To increase total maximum regular push ups, aim for 4 sets of 13 push ups per class

Case study for Student B:
- Student B can currently do 3 maximum full push ups
- Setting a reasonable goal of 10 maximum full push ups is a great goal for this student
- To build more strength, Student B can do 1 - 2 full push ups, then push up negatives up to an RPE of 8
- By splitting the movements into a harder and easier variation, the student can both work on the goal variation (full push up) but not be limited by their current strength level
- To build more endurance, Student B can do 8 - 10 knee push ups maintaining good form
- The easier variation allows for an appropriate amount of volume

Both of these variations and ranges challenge the students to the same degree and both will progress at the pace that's appropriate for their ability level
